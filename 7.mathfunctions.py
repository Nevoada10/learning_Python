import math  # module # library

pi = 3.14  # not exactly hehe

x = 1
y = 2
z = 3

# Default Python
print(round(pi))  # will round to the closest integer.
print(abs(pi))  # will show you to absolut value
print(pow(pi, 2))  # will exponentially multiply the first number of the argument # 3.14Ë†2
print(max(pi, x, y, z))  # shows the biggest number of the ones that have been chosen.
print(min(pi, x, y, z))  # shows the smallest number of the ones that have been chosen.

# Math module
print(math.ceil(pi))  # will round up to the closest integer
print(math.floor(pi))  # will round down to the closest integer
print(math.sqrt(pi))  # will show you the square root of the number.
